## Overview

This project is an **Age & Gender Prediction** system built in Python. It takes input images (faces) and tries to predict:

* **Age** of the person
* **Gender** of the person

It includes:

* A web / desktop / CLI (depending on your implementation) interface in `app.py`
* Preprocessed image datasets
* Pretrained ML models stored under `models/`
* Notebooks for experiments and visualizations under `notebook/`

---

## Features

* Predicts *gender* (male/female) from face images
* Predicts *age* (numeric or categories)
* Uses image dataset(s) for training
* Allows for exploring with Jupyter notebooks
* Includes sample images/screenshots

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s how the repo is organized:

```
age_gender_predictor/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ datasets/               # original, processed, or supplemental datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ gender_images/          # raw images for age/gender classification
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                 # saved/trained ML model artifacts
â”œâ”€â”€ notebook/               # Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
â”œâ”€â”€ screenshots/            # sample outputs & visualizations
â”œâ”€â”€ gender_images.zip       # compressed images (raw)
â”œâ”€â”€ gender_images2.zip      # another set / backup
â”œâ”€â”€ .DS_Store               # macOS file (should be gitignored)
```

## Setup & Installation

Hereâ€™s how you can get this running on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Messiri4/age_gender_predictor.git
   cd age_gender_predictor
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   Thereâ€™s no `requirements.txt` currently in the repo: make sure to create one. Some likely dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras opencv-python
   ```

4. **Download / Extract data**

   If `gender_images.zip` or `gender_images2.zip` are required, unzip them into the `gender_images/` folder (or wherever your scripts expect them).

5. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   (Modify if there are arguments / parameters, or if it serves via a web framework.)

## Model Training & Dataset

* **Datasets**: describe the source of your image data. Was it collected manually or from public datasets? Size? Balanced across ages/genders?

* **Preprocessing**: resizing, normalization, face-detection, augmentation etc.

* **Model architecture**: what model(s) you used (e.g. CNN, transfer learning with e.g. VGG / ResNet), hyperparameters.

* **Training details**: epochs, batch size, loss functions, optimizers, any validation splits, accuracy/performance metrics.

* **Saved models**: stored in `models/` â€” specify which models are ready to use (e.g. `model_age.h5`, `gender_model.pkl`, etc.)
